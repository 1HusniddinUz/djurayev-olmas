    aboutUsP: `If you feel a resonance with my work, I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're an investor, creator, partner, or simply someone moved by the vision — your presence matters.\n\nThe most beautiful futures are co-created. If something in you is awakened by what you see here, that's not coincidence — it's resonance. And resonance is the beginning of collaboration.\n\nShare your thoughts, inquiries, or simply introduce yourself. Every connection holds possibility.`,
