    aboutUsH3: "DJO'RAYEV O'LMAS SADULLOYEVICH",
    aboutUsP: `Juraev Olmasjon Sadulloyevich is a worthy successor to a lineage of craftsmen who have transmitted the traditions of rubob making from generation to generation. In 1999, at the age of 17, he continued this ancestral craft on a professional footing. His rubobs are distinguished by a refined timbre, precise tuning, and meticulous workmanship, and are highly valued by customers. His instruments are widely present across various regions of Uzbekistan and have earned recognition in the markets of Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; they are also appreciated by Uzbek enthusiasts in the United States.

As a master, he has trained four apprentices, ensuring the stable continuity of the master–apprentice tradition. His efforts serve the preservation and promotion of the national musical heritage, the development of craftsmanship, and the strengthening of youth employment. In this way, he contributes to aligning rubob making with modern requirements and to its competitive and sustainable development.`,
